    `<system>...</system>` content in `Model.prepare_messages`. Leading ones still hoist to the
    provider's top-level system parameter.

    APIs that only accept an inline system prompt in certain positions (e.g. Anthropic requires it
    to follow a user turn) still set this to `True`; it's on their model adapters to make the
    positions the API rejects legal. Preserving the part's authority is worth more than preserving
    the exact position it was authored at — an instruction only governs the generation that follows
    it, and that's the same generation either way — so prefer adjusting placement over falling back
    to the `<system>...</system>` rendering, which the model reads as user-authored. Anthropic slides
    the entry past intervening user turns and gives it a minimal user turn to follow when nothing
    legal precedes it.

    `Provider.model_profile` is resolved from the model name alone, so when support also turns on
    something it can't see — which SDK client the provider was built with, say — the adapter narrows
    this in its own `Model.profile` override, as Anthropic does for Microsoft Foundry. Narrowing the
    flag rather than special-casing the adapter's own rendering keeps `Model.prepare_messages` the
    only place that knows the `<system>...</system>` fallback.

    changing the `tools` block. Providers differ on whether that's usable on its own: Anthropic accepts a
    deferred tool with no search tool in sight, while the OpenAI Responses API answers
    `Invalid Value: 'tools.defer_loading'. Deferred tools require tools.tool_search.` (verified live on
    `gpt-5.6`).
