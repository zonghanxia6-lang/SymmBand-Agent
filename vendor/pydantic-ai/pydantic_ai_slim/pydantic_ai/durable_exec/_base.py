        worker's environment implies — so the request would quietly go to another endpoint with
        other credentials. Registering the instance in `models=`, or passing a model-name string
        that a [`ResolveModelId`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ResolveModelId] capability builds
        worker-side, are the two ways to get a specific instance into a durable run.
