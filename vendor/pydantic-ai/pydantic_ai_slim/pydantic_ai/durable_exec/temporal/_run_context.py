    """The [`RunContext`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext] subclass to use to serialize and deserialize the run context for use inside a Temporal activity.

    By default, only the `deps`, `run_id`, `conversation_id`, `metadata`, `retries`, `tool_call_id`, `tool_name`, `tool_call_approved`, `tool_call_metadata`, `retry`, `max_retries`, `run_step`, `usage`, `usage_limits`, `partial_output`, `trace_include_content`, `instrumentation_version`, `loaded_capability_ids`, `discovered_tool_names`, and `capability_loaded` attributes will be available. Reading any other attribute raises a `UserError` explaining how to make it available, rather than returning its default value, so a field that didn't cross the boundary can't be mistaken for real run state.

    `agent` and `root_capability` are re-attached from the worker's agent instance, `pending_messages` holds a guard that makes [`enqueue`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue] raise inside an activity, and `tool_manager` is `None`: it holds live tool state that isn't serializable, so `available_tool_names` falls back to `discovered_tool_names`. The `capabilities` registry is excluded for the same reason — it holds live capability objects (toolsets, hooks, callables) — which means `available_capability_ids` (which reads it) is unavailable inside an activity. `model` and `tracer` are excluded as live objects too. `messages` is excluded because the full history would be duplicated into every activity payload, and `prompt` is excluded because a multi-modal prompt can carry large `BinaryContent` that would likewise ride in every activity payload, risking Temporal's 2 MB limit. `model_settings` is excluded because it's only set for model requests, which receive it as their own activity parameter, and `validation_context` because it's an arbitrary user object with no serialization contract.
    To make another attribute available, create a `TemporalRunContext` subclass with a custom `serialize_run_context` class method that returns a dictionary that includes the attribute and pass it as the `run_context_type` argument to [`TemporalDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.temporal.TemporalDurability]. A subclass can use this escape hatch to opt in to carrying `prompt` if it knows its prompts are text-only.
