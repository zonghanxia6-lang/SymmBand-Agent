"""Validation of per-run toolsets for durable execution engines.

Durable execution engines (DBOS, Prefect, Temporal) durably wrap the *executing* toolsets an agent is
constructed with — function tools become steps/tasks/activities and MCP servers get their I/O
checkpointed — so their side effects are recorded and replayed deterministically. Toolsets passed
per-run via `run(toolsets=...)` arrive after that wrapping has happened (and, for Temporal, after
activities have been registered with the worker), so an *executing* runtime toolset would run
un-checkpointed inside the workflow.

We therefore reject executing runtime toolsets, while still allowing non-executing ones like
`ExternalToolset` whose tools are resolved outside the agent run and so need no durable wrapping.

Classification mirrors the engines' own wrapping: only the leaf types the wrappers durabilize
(`FunctionToolset`, `MCPToolset`) plus `DynamicToolset` (whose contents can't be inspected up front)
are rejected. A custom `AbstractToolset` leaf that executes I/O isn't recognized and passes through —
the same blind spot the constructor-time `dbosify`/`prefectify`/`temporalize` wrapping already has for
unknown leaf types.
