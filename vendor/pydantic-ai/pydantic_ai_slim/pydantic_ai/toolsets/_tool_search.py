"""Tool search toolset and strategy types.

`ToolSearchToolset` wraps another toolset to support discovery of tools marked with
`defer_loading=True`. It settles the one question that doesn't depend on which model
serves the request — is this tool *searchable*? — and leaves the rest to
[`Model.prepare_request`][pydantic_ai.models.Model.prepare_request], which can't be
decided here because the model isn't known yet (think `FallbackModel`).

The two questions a deferred tool raises are kept apart:

* **Hidden until revealed** — true of every deferred tool. Carried by the authored
  `defer_loading` value, which stays set for the whole run, with current visibility
  travelling separately on `ModelRequestParameters.revealed_tool_names`.
* **Member of the searchable corpus** — carried by `with_native='tool_search'`, and set
  only on deferred tools no on-demand capability gates. A capability-gated tool becomes
  available by loading its capability, never by querying for it.

`Model.prepare_request` then decides, per model, how each hidden tool reaches the wire:

* Where the provider can declare a tool but withhold its schema, hidden tools stay in
  `tools` behind the provider's deferral flag (Anthropic `defer_loading`, OpenAI
  Responses `defer_loading`) and a reveal unlocks them in place, leaving `tools`
  byte-identical across the reveal.
* Otherwise hidden tools are kept off the wire entirely and arrive when they're revealed
  — as a full declaration on providers with a mid-conversation reveal item, or simply as
  a new `tools` entry where there's no such item.

`search_tools`, the local discovery function, carries `unless_native='tool_search'`
and is dropped by the adapter when the builtin is supported. When the capability commits
to a named-native strategy with no local equivalent (`'bm25'`/`'regex'`) the toolset is
constructed with `enable_fallback=False` and `search_tools` is not emitted at all — that
way `_resolve_native_tool_swap` raises on providers that can't honor the builtin, and
the wire stays clean (just the native tool) on those that can.
