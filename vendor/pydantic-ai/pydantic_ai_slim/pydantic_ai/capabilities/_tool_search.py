class ToolSearch(AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]):
    """Capability that provides tool discovery for large toolsets.

    Tools marked with `defer_loading=True` are hidden from the model until discovered.
    Auto-injected into every agent — zero overhead when no deferred tools exist.

    When the model supports native tool search (Anthropic BM25/regex, OpenAI Responses),
    discovery is handled by the provider: the deferred tools are sent with `defer_loading`
    on the wire and the provider exposes them once they've been discovered. Otherwise,
    discovery happens locally via a `search_tools` function that the model can call.

    On providers that support a native "client-executed" surface (Anthropic, OpenAI),
    the discovery message is delivered append-only — prompt cache is preserved across
    discovery turns, so growing the message history with discovered-tool results does
    not invalidate the cached prefix.

    * `'keywords'`: always use the local keyword-overlap algorithm. Still prompt-cache
      compatible on providers that expose a "client-executed" native surface (Anthropic,
