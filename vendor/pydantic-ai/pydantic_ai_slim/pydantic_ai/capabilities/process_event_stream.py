@dataclass
class ProcessEventStream(AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]):
    """A capability that forwards the agent's event stream to a user-provided async handler.

    The handler receives the stream of [`AgentStreamEvent`][pydantic_ai.messages.AgentStreamEvent]s
    emitted during model streaming and tool execution for each `ModelRequestNode` and
    `CallToolsNode`. Two forms are supported:

    - An [`EventStreamHandler`][pydantic_ai.agent.EventStreamHandler] — an `async def`
      returning `None`. Events are forwarded to the handler while also being passed
      through unchanged to the rest of the capability chain, so multiple handlers (and
      the top-level `event_stream_handler` argument) can all see the same stream without
      changing each other's view. A handler that returns early stops receiving events
      but does not affect downstream consumers; a handler that raises propagates the
      exception to the rest of the run. Events are delivered synchronously, so a slow
      handler back-pressures the rest of the stream.
    - An `EventStreamProcessor` — an async
      generator yielding [`AgentStreamEvent`][pydantic_ai.messages.AgentStreamEvent]s.
      The events it yields replace the inner stream for downstream wrappers and consumers,
      so it can modify, drop, or add events.

      This replacement is global, not a private view for event-stream handlers: the run has one
      event stream and a processor shapes all of it. Dropping or rewriting a
      [`PartDeltaEvent`][pydantic_ai.messages.PartDeltaEvent] therefore also changes what
      [`stream_text()`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_text] yields to a
      `run_stream()` caller.

      Some events are also control signals:
      [`FinalResultEvent`][pydantic_ai.messages.FinalResultEvent] is what tells
      [`agent.run_stream()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run_stream] that the final output has
      started, so dropping it makes `run_stream()` wait for the whole model response before handing
      back the result instead of streaming it. Filter deliberately.

      None of this changes the run's output: the
      [`ModelResponse`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse] is accumulated from the raw model
      stream before a processor sees the events, so
      [`stream_output()`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_output] and the final
      validated output are unaffected (dropping events can only change when a partial snapshot is
      emitted, not its content). Use the observer form if you only want to watch events.

    When this capability is registered, `agent.run()` and
    [`AgentRun.next()`][pydantic_ai.run.AgentRun.next] automatically enable streaming so the
    handler fires without requiring an explicit `event_stream_handler` argument. The handler
    sees the same events however the run is driven, including under
    [`agent.iter()`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.iter] and when you stream a node yourself with
    `node.stream()`.

    !!! note "Durable execution"

        Under the durable-execution capabilities
        ([`TemporalDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.temporal.TemporalDurability],
        [`DBOSDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.dbos.DBOSDurability],
        [`PrefectDurability`][pydantic_ai.durable_exec.prefect.PrefectDurability]),
        this capability's handler always runs in workflow or flow code and must be
        deterministic because it re-runs on workflow replay. Tool-call and final-output
        events arrive live; model events are the real captured events replayed after each
        model-request activity, step, or task completes. For handler I/O that must run
        exactly once inside a durable boundary, pass `event_stream_handler=` to the
        durability capability instead.
