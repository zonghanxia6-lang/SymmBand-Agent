"""Model-continuation primitives shared by the agent graph.

A *continuation* happens when a model returns a `ModelResponse` with
`state == 'suspended'` (Anthropic `pause_turn`, OpenAI background mode, …): the
graph re-issues the request with the suspended response echoed back, and the
provider resumes the same logical turn. This module owns the provider-agnostic
glue for stitching those segments back into a single response/stream:

- [`merge_responses`][pydantic_ai.models._continuation.merge_responses] folds a
  continuation response into the one it continues.
- [`merge_mode`][pydantic_ai.models._continuation.merge_mode] reports whether a
  continuation *replaces* or *accumulates*, so the streamed composite can reindex
  parts consistently with the merge.
- [`_ContinuationStreamedResponse`][pydantic_ai.models._continuation._ContinuationStreamedResponse]
  drives the streamed loop, presenting every segment as one continuous stream.

This module is deliberately decoupled from `_agent_graph`: it imports only from
`models`, `messages`, `usage`, `exceptions`, and the stdlib. Pluggable timing is
injected as `sleep_func` so the loop stays free of `now_utc()`/RNG and replays
deterministically under durable executors (e.g. Temporal).
