            api_key: The [Vertex AI Express Mode API key](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/api-keys?usertype=expressmode)
                to use for authentication. It can also be set via the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable,
                or the legacy `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable (`GOOGLE_API_KEY` takes precedence).
                Explicit `credentials` use credential-based authentication instead.
                Explicit `project`/`location` use Application Default Credentials.
                `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` takes precedence over an API key from the environment.
            credentials: The credentials to use for authentication when calling the Google Cloud APIs. Credentials can
                be obtained from environment variables and default credentials. For more information, see
                [Set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials).
                Credentials that require scopes are automatically scoped with
                `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`.
            project: The Google Cloud project ID to use for quota. Can be obtained from environment variables
                (for example, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`).
            location: The location to send API requests to, for example `us-central1` (a single region) or
                `global`. `'us'` and `'eu'` are multi-region values routed to the `aiplatform.{us,eu}.rep.googleapis.com`
                data-residency endpoints. Model availability differs between single regions, multi-regions, and
                `global` — see the
                [Vertex AI locations docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations#available-regions).
                Can be obtained from the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` environment variable.
            client: A pre-initialized client to use.
            http_client: An existing `httpx.AsyncClient` to use for making HTTP requests.
            base_url: The base URL for the Google Cloud API.
            retry_options: HTTP retry options for transient errors (429, 5xx, etc.).
                See `google.genai.types.HttpRetryOptions` for available fields.
