    A step the run awaits — a Temporal activity under `WAIT_CANCELLATION_COMPLETED`, an

    `task.cancel()` and return normally. asyncio even *delegates* a task's cancellation to the

    completes the awaiting task too. Either way the cancellation is an edge the framework never
    sees, and without a re-check the run would complete as if it was never cancelled.

    Well-behaved consumers of their own cancellation, like `asyncio.timeout()` and AnyIO cancel
    scopes, balance `Task.cancelling()` back down with `Task.uncancel()`, so a positive count at
    a step boundary is treated as a still-pending cancellation of the run and re-raised. This is
    deliberately a *policy*, not a proof of external intent: code awaited by the run that cancels
    its own task as an internal wake-up and suppresses the `CancelledError` without calling
    `Task.uncancel()` (a pre-3.11 idiom) will be read as a cancelled run. Call this only after
    the just-completed step's results have been recorded to message history, so cancellation
    never discards completed work.

    The re-raise is a fresh `CancelledError`: the originally-injected exception object (and any
    message it carried) was consumed by whatever absorbed it and cannot be recovered — the
    cancellation *state* is re-asserted, not the original exception.

    On Python 3.10 `Task.cancelling()` does not exist and this is a no-op: an absorbed external
    cancellation cannot be reliably detected there, so the cancellation guarantee is documented
